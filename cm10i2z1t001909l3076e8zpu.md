## Understanding the Vulnerability

[Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) is a type of attack that tricks a user's browser into performing unwanted actions on a website where the user is authenticated. In the context of the [PeepSo](https://www.peepso.com/) plugin, this could potentially allow an attacker to:

1. Modify user settings without permission
    
2. Post content on behalf of logged-in users
    
3. Alter community configurations
    

## Technical Details

* **CWE Classification**: CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
    
* **CVSS Vector**: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
    

This vector indicates that the attack:

* Requires no special privileges
    
* Can be launched from the network
    
* Needs user interaction
    
* Has a low impact on confidentiality and availability, but some impact on integrity.
